# ru-cli
Rewrite some CLI which have simplified input and output systems.

### Must do:
- `echo:` repeats input
- `cat:` concatenates files
- `ls:` lists directories
- `find:` locates files or directories
- `grep:` matches text in files

### Nice to do:
- Add extra flags to the these command line
- Error hanlder
- `find and grep` with multi-threading support
- Add colorized output
